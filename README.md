# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

This project is a marketing agency website called Horiseon, and the goal is to have a codebase that adheres to accessibility standards. Ensuring that the website follows these standards is essential for optimising the site for search engines and providing an inclusive user experience.

## Accessibility Standards

To meet accessibility standards, the codebase incorporates the following practices:

Semantic HTML Elements:
The source code uses semantic HTML elements to enhance the structure and meaning of content

Logical Structure:
HTML elements are structured logically, independent of styling and positioning. This ensures that the content remains accessible even if styles are disabled.

Accessible Alt Attributes:
Image and icon elements include descriptive and accessible alt attributes. This practice ensures that users with visual impairments or those using screen readers can understand the content conveyed by the images.

Sequential Heading Attributes:
Heading attributes follow a sequential order (h1, h2, h3, and so on), contributing to a clear and organized hierarchy in the document structure.
Concise and Descriptive Title:

The title element contains a concise and descriptive title for the webpage. This title is aimed at providing users and search engines with a clear understanding of the page's content.
